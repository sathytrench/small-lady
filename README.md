a creepy game about a small lady

## test

`nvm use`

`npm run start-dev`

sequence:

1. title screens
-> press enter to begin
2. introduction to map room
-> press enter to explore the library
3. library - choose one of three books to make secret item appear. pick up item
-> how to leave a room? press enter again when prompted? walk out of a door on screen?
4. back to map! unlock whatever rooms you can. When you enter a room, the name of that room
  should correspond to the name of a Scene
-> how do we move BOTH around the map AND into rooms seamlessly? when player moves into center of next room, dissolve into ThatRoomScene? every time, or just the first time?
